I'm an experienced Developer and DevOps, and have been working with technology since I was a kid.

I've written code as a developer and worked as a SysAdmin for startups, retailers, e-merchants, Financial Institutions, and even French territorial organisms.

## About Me

Hello ! I am Bruno, from north of France, married, and dad of a little girl.

My Skillset includes :

- **System administration** : I Worked for five years as a SysAdmin with heterogenous infrastructures.
- **Automation** : Experience showed me that when you reduce as mush as possible human interraction with an infrastructure, errors are less likely to show up !
- **Clean Coding** : When I am writing code, i always think about who will read it, and how it can evolve.
- **Continuous Refactoring** : As it is said, perfection is not reached when there is nothing more to _add_, but when there is nothing left to _remove_.
- **Security** : Zero Result in a security audit is my goal.

In my opinion, to reach success for a software product, it needs two key ingredients : Focus on the value for the end-user and set up the very best technical practices.
