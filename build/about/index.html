  <p>I'm an experienced Developer and DevOps, and have been working with technology since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I've written code as a developer and worked as a SysAdmin for startups, retailers, e-merchants, Financial Institutions, and even French territorial organisms.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello ! I am Bruno, from north of France, married, and dad of a little girl.</p>
<p>My Skillset includes :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System administration</strong> : I Worked for five years as a SysAdmin with heterogenous infrastructures.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> : Experience showed me that when you reduce as mush as possible human interraction with an infrastructure, errors are less likely to show up !</li>
<li><strong>Clean Coding</strong> : When I am writing code, i always think about who will read it, and how it can evolve.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Refactoring</strong> : As it is said, perfection is not reached when there is nothing more to <em>add</em>, but when there is nothing left to <em>remove</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> : Zero Result in a security audit is my goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, to reach success for a software product, it needs two key ingredients : Focus on the value for the end-user and set up the very best technical practices.</p>
